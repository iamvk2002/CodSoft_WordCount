# CodSoft_WordCount
# Word Count using C++

## Description

This is a simple C++ program that reads a text file and counts the number of words in it. The program prompts the user to enter the name of the file, reads the content of the file, and then calculates the total number of words in the file. It considers words as any continuous sequence of characters separated by spaces or newlines.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files to your local machine.

2. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:

   ```
   g++ word_count.cpp -o word_count
   ```

4. Run the program:

   ```
   ./word_count
   ```

5. The program will prompt you to enter the name of the file you want to analyze.

6. Provide the filename along with its extension (e.g., `sample.txt`).

7. The program will process the file, count the words, and display the total number of words in the file.

## Sample Output

```
Enter the Name of File: sample.txt

Total Words = 27
```
